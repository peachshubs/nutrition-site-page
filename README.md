This webpage is a prototype design for the "Diabetes" section of the NutriHive (nutritional advice) website which is responsible for analyzing the blood glucose readings of customers diagnosed with diabetes. According to the readings, customers will receive a personalized meal plan (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) along with snack recommendations catered to any additional health issues that the customer may have. Exercise and fitness tips have also been provided with graphs which display the blood glucose levels' variation according to that fitness routine. General advice regarding treatment of diabetes in everyday life has also been provided.
